In my spare time I created and maintain the [JavaScript Redstone Simulator](http://mordritch.com/mc_rss/), full time I work for a company which develops software for corporates, mostly in C#. As part of developing my JavaScript Redstone Simulator, I have also written a "good enough" Java to TypeScript transpiler.
